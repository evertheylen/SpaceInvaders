# Controller

A controller does control stuff! It can only control one model at a time. Initialize it with the parent Game.

It does not really have any methods. That's the thing with controllers. It just uses other classes' methods.

Controllers may read about the Model to properly send Events. (Like getting a pointer to the player)
