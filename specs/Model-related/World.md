# World

A world contains Entities, and that's about it. It structures the world, but it'll probably be a bunch of pointers to entities.

All entities have (x,y)-coordinates, ordened like this:

    y ^            
      |            
      | .(2,5)     
      |            
      |            
      |      .(7,2)
      |             
      +------------>
                   x
