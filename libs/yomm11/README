This library implements open multi-methods for C++11.

Salient features are:

* syntax: is relatively uncluttered. There are no limitations on the
  number of virtual arguments. Virtual and non-virtual arguments can
  be arbitrarily mixed. Virtual and multiple inheritance are
  supported.

* speed: close to a virtual function call when the hierarchies
  involved in the virtual arguments collaborate with the
  library. Calling a method that does nothing, with a single virtual
  argument in a single inheritance hierarchy is 33% slower than the
  equivalent virtual function call. The difference becomes
  unnoticeable if the functions perform a few simple maths
  operations. See tests/benchmarks.cpp.

* size: dispatch tables are constructed in terms of class groups. This
  results in a tables devoid of redundancies.

* support for "foreign" class hierarchies: the library can be used
  without modifications to existing classes, at the cost of lower
  performance. Collaborating and foreign arguments can be freely
  mixed. Performance is still quite good, see the benchmarks.

* next: a pointer to the next most specialized method is available
  inside method specializations - see examples/next.cpp.
  Alternatively, it is possible to call a specialization directly.
