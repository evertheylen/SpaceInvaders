[section virtual_]

[h3 Synopsis]
virtual_<__class__>

[h3 Description]

`virtual_` denotes virtual arguments in a multi-method declaration.

__class__ must be a class type registered via one of the `MM_*CLASS`
macros. It can appear only in multi-method argument lists to declare a
reference to an object, constant or not. In other words, `virtual_`
may be used only in the following manner:

    virtual_<SomeType>&
    const virtual_<SomeType>&
