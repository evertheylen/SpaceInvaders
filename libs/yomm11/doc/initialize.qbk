[section initialize]

[h3 Synopsis]

yorel::methods::initialize();

[h3 Description]

Computes or re-computes the data structures underlying multi-method
dispatch.

`initialize` should be called after all the classes and
multi-methods have been declared and before calling any multi-method,
typically at the beginning of `main()`. If classes or multi-methods
are added or removed (e.g. because of dynamic loading or un-loading of
shared libraries), `intitialize` must be called again.

Initialization is a fairly expensive process, which involves among
other things topologically sorting class hierarchies, assigning slots
to multi-methods and computing dispatch tables. `initialize`
attempts to be conservative and re-compute only what needs be;
however, adding or removing a single class or multi-method
entails the re-examination of the entire class graph.

[h3 Examples]

``

int main() {
  yorel::methods::initialize();
  // ...
  dlopen(...); // dynamically load a shared object
  yorel::methods::initialize(); // if classes, multi-methods or specializations were added
  // ...
}

``
