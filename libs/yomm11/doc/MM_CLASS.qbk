[section MM_CLASS]

[h3 Synopsis]

MM_CLASS(__class__, __bases__...)

[h3 Description]

Registers a class for efficient multi-method dispatch.

Macro `MM_CLASS` must be called inside the definition of __class__. The
subsequent arguments __bases__ consist in the (possibly empty) list 
of base classes that the dispatcher must take into account. __class__
must derive (directly or indirectly) from __selector__.

[h3 Example]
``
struct animal : yorel::methods::selector {
  MM_CLASS(animal);
};

struct female : virtual animal {
  MM_CLASS(female, animal);
};

struct horse : virtual animal {
  MM_CLASS(horse, animal);
};

struct mare : horse, female {
  MM_CLASS(mare, horse, female);
};
``

[h3 Implementation notes]

`MM_CLASS` expands to:

``
  virtual void _mm_init_class_() {
    &::yorel::methods::mm_class_initializer<CLASS, ::methods::type_list<BASES>>::the;
  }
``

This forces the instantiation of a class template and one static object that fills an internal data structure with inheritance information.
