# Dispatchers

Dispatchers are part of the Model. Every relevant Event has a dispatcher handling it. Dispatchers can call dispatchers. They are preprocessed by P-p-p-p-pyyythooon.

They are either a closely integrated class, or just a plain member function within the Model. They call the actual logic in the Model.
